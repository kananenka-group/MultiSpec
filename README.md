# MultiSpec
 
MultiSpec is a set of tools to calculate various types of vibrational spectra of condensed-phase systems.
Currently the following systems are supported:

- Pure water. This includes H2O, D2O and isotope mixtures: D2O/H2O.

The following types of spectra are supported:

- IR
- Raman: VV and VH polarizations
- SFG: ssp and ppp polarizations
